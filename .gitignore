### Terraform ###
# Local .terraform directories
infrastructure/.terraform
infrastructure/.terraform.lock.hcl

# .tfstate files
infrastructure/*.tfstate
infrastructure/*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.
#
# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
infrastructure/override.tf
infrastructure/override.tf.json
infrastructure/*_override.tf
infrastructure/*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*
